# 3x3-Blindfolded-Memorization-Trainer

Simulates a Rubik's 3x3 Cube then takes in an algorithm as input and simulates the moves on the cube. 
Afterwards prompts users for the traditional 3x3 blindfolded memorization letters seperated by spaces, including asking if there is parity on the cube. 
The program then simulates solving the cube using the Old Pochmann blindfolded solving method to ensure the memorization was correct. 
Program finally outputs whether the edges, corners, and entire cube were solved or not.
